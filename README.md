With AutoHotkey, you can tailor your keyboard layout or set shortcuts for frequently used functions. It allows users to craft scripts for routine text entries, such as adding email signatures or completing online forms. You can also control the mouse or joystick using keyboard commands. Opening your favorite programs and documents becomes effortless with customizable hotkeys. The tool simplifies managing window sizes and positions. Additionally, AutoHotkey lets you schedule automatic tasks like backups, system scans, or reminders. For advanced users, it provides tools to interact with system functions, organize files and directories, and handle pointers for more intricate operations.

## Features
- **Installation flexibility:** AutoHotkey's setup process offers numerous customizable options.
